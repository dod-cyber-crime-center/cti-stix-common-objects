            "description": "The CGI script <redacted>.sh can be used to download any file on the filesystem.\n\nThis issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC model chargers beforeversion 24120701.\n\nLikelihood: High, but credentials required.\n\nImpact: Critical – The script can be used to download any file on the filesystem, including sensitive files such as /etc/shadow, the CGI script source code or binaries and configuration files.\n\nCVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/S:P/AU:Y\nCVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). The confidentiality of all files of the devicd can be compromised (VC:H/VI:N/VA:N).  There is no impact on subsequent systems. (SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). While this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, this attack in isolation does not have a safety impact. The attack can be automated (AU:Y).",
