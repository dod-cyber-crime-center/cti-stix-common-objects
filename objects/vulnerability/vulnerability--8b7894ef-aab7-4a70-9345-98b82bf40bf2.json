            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in BACnet ATEC 550-440 (All versions), BACnet ATEC 550-441 (All versions), BACnet ATEC 550-445 (All versions), BACnet ATEC 550-446 (All versions). Affected devices improperly handle specific incoming BACnet MSTP messages. This could allow an attacker residing in the same BACnet network to send a specially crafted MSTP message that results in a denial of service condition of the targeted device. A power cycle is required to restore the device's normal operation.",
