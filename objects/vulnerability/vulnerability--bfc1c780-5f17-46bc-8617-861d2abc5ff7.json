            "description": "A vulnerability in an API subsystem of Cisco Secure Network Analytics Manager and Cisco Secure Network Analytics Virtual Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges to generate fraudulent findings that are used to generate alarms and alerts on an affected product.\r\n\r\nThi vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement on a specific API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as a low-privileged user and performing API calls with crafted input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obfuscate legitimate findings in analytics reports or create false indications with alarms and alerts on an affected device.",
