            "description": "Horilla is a free and open source Human Resource Management System (HRMS). In versions up to and including 1.3, an attacker can craft a Horilla URL that refers to an external domain. Upon clicking and logging in, the user is redirected to an external domain. This allows the redirection to any arbitrary site, including phishing or malicious domains, which can be used to impersonate Horilla and trick users. Commit 1c72404df6888bb23af73c767fdaee5e6679ebd6 fixes the issue.",
