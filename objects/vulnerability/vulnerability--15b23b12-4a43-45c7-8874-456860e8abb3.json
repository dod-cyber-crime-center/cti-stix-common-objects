Versions prior to 2.0.3 have a cross-site scripting vulnerability when the sanitizer is used with a `contentEditable` element to set the elements `innerHTML` to a sanitized string produced by the package. If the code is particularly crafted to abuse the code beautifier, that runs AFTER sanitation. The issue is patched in version 2.0.3.",
