            "description": "Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to code injection. The ckpt_path2 variable takes user input (e.g. a path to a model) and passes it to change_info_ function, which opens and reads the file on the given path (except it changes the final on the path to train.log), and passes the contents of the file to eval, which can lead to remote code execution. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.",
