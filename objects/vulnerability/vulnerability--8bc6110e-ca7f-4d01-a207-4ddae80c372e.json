            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: isotp: split tx timer into transmission and timeout\n\nThe timer for the transmission of isotp PDUs formerly had two functions:\n1. send two consecutive frames with a given time gap\n2. monitor the timeouts for flow control frames and the echo frames\n\nThis led to larger txstate checks and potentially to a problem discovered\nby syzbot which enabled the panic_on_warn feature while testing.\n\nThe former 'txtimer' function is split into 'txfrtimer' and 'txtimer'\nto handle the two above functionalities with separate timer callbacks.\n\nThe two simplified timers now run in one-shot mode and make the state\ntransitions (especially with isotp_rcv_echo) better understandable.",
