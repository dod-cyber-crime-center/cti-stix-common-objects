            "description": "Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.",
