            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: skbprio: Remove overly strict queue assertions\n\nIn the current implementation, skbprio enqueue/dequeue contains an assertion\nthat fails under certain conditions when SKBPRIO is used as a child qdisc under\nTBF with specific parameters. The failure occurs because TBF sometimes peeks at\npackets in the child qdisc without actually dequeuing them when tokens are\nunavailable.\n\nThis peek operation creates a discrepancy between the parent and child qdisc\nqueue length counters. When TBF later receives a high-priority packet,\nSKBPRIO's queue length may show a different value than what's reflected in its\ninternal priority queue tracking, triggering the assertion.\n\nThe fix removes this overly strict assertions in SKBPRIO, they are not\nnecessary at all.",
