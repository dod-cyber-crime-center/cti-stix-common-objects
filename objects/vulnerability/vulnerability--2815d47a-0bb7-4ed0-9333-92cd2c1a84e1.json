            "description": "An Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output vulnerability in the Sampling Route Record Daemon (SRRD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nWhen a device configured for flow-monitoring receives a specific BGP update message, it is correctly processed internally by the routing protocol daemon (rpd), but when it's sent to SRRD it's encoded incorrectly which leads to a crash and momentary interruption of jflow processing until it automatically restarts. This issue does not affect traffic forwarding itself.\nThis issue affects Junos OS:Â \n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,\n  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10,\n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,\n  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.\n\n\n\nThis issue does not affected Junos OS Evolved.",
