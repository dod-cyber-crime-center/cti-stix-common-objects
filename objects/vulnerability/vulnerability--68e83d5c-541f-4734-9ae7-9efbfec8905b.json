            "description": "The Envolve Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 via the 'zetra_deleteLanguageFile' and 'zetra_deleteFontsFile' functions. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a file or its path prior to deleting it. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete language files.",
