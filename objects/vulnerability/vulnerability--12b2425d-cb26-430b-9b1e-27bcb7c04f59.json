            "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, formerly Cisco SD-WAN vManage, could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local file system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid read-only credentials with CLI access on the affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files that are on the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a series of crafted commands on the local file system of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected device and gain privileges of the root user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have CLI access as a low-privilege user.",
