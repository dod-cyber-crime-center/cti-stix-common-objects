            "description": "Internet Starter, one of SoftCOM iKSORIS system modules, is vulnerable to client-side Denial of Servise (DoS) attacks. An attacker might trick a user into using an URL with a d parameter set to an unhandled value. All the subsequent requests will not be accepted as the server returns an error message. Since this parameter is sent as part of a session cookie, the issue persists until the session expires or the user deletes cookies manually. \nSimilar effect might be achieved when a user tries to change platform language to an unimplemented one.\nThis vulnerability has been patched in version 79.0",
