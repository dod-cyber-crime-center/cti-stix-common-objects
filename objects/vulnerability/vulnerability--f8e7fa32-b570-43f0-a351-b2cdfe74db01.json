            "description": "Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework. Due to a flaw in multi-line SNMP result parser, authenticated users can inject malformed OIDs in the response. When processed by ss_net_snmp_disk_io() or ss_net_snmp_disk_bytes(), a part of each OID will be used as a key in an array that is used as part of a system command, causing a command execution vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.29.",
