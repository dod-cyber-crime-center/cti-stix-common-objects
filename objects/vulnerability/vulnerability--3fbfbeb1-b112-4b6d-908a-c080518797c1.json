            "description": "The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file moving due to insufficient file path validation via the wc-upload-file[] parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php).",
