            "description": "The Cardealer theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'update_user_profile' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the user email and password via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
