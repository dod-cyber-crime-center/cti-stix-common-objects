            "description": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') vulnerability in Apache Airflow Common SQL Provider.\n\nWhen using the partition clause in SQLTableCheckOperator as parameter (which was a recommended pattern), Authenticated UI User could inject arbitrary SQL command when triggering DAG exposing partition_clause to the user.\nThis allowed the DAG Triggering user to escalate privileges to execute those arbitrary commands which they normally would not have.\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Airflow Common SQL Provider: before 1.24.1.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.24.1, which fixes the issue.",
