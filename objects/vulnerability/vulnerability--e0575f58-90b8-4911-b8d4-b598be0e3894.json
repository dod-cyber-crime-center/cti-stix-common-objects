            "description": "A vulnerability in certification validation routines of Cisco ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent for macOS and RoomOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to intercept or manipulate metrics information.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly validate certificates for hosted metrics services. An on-path attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting network traffic using a crafted certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to masquerade as a trusted host and monitor or change communications between the remote metrics service and the vulnerable client.",
