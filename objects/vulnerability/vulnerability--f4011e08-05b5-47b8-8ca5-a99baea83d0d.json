            "description": "The Uncanny Automator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.0.1 via deserialization of untrusted input in the automator_api_decode_message() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files.",
