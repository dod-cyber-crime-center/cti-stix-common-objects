            "description": "An Improper Handling of Additional Special Element vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-MPC, MS-MIC and SPC3, and SRX Series, allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nIf the SIP ALG processes specifically formatted SIP invites, a memory corruption will occur which will lead to a crash of the FPC processing these packets. Although the system will automatically recover with the restart of the FPC, subsequent SIP invites will cause the crash again and lead to a sustained DoS.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on MX Series and SRX Series:Â \n\n  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,\n  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10,\n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,\n  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S5,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3,\n  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S3,\n  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2.",
