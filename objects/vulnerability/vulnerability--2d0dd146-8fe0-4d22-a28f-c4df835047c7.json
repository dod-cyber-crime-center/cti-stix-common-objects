Attackers \nwith administrative access to a specific subset of privileged features \nin the console can elevate their permissions to access additional \nfeatures in the console. The attack complexity is low, there are no \npreexisting attack requirements; the privileges required are high, and \nthere is no user interaction required. The impact to system \nconfidentiality is low, the impact to system integrity is high and the \nimpact to system availability is low.",
