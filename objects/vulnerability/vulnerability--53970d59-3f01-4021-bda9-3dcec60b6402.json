            "description": "The Frontend Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the fed_admin_setting_form_function() function in versions 1.0 to 2.2.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the pluginâ€™s 'register' role setting to make new user registrations default to the administrator role, leading to an elevation of privileges to that of an administrator.",
