            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in APOGEE PXC+TALON TC Series (BACnet) (All versions). Affected devices start sending unsolicited BACnet broadcast messages after processing a specific BACnet createObject request. This could allow an attacker residing in the same BACnet network to send a specially crafted message that results in a partial denial of service condition of the targeted device, and potentially reduce the availability of BACnet network. A power cycle is required to restore the device's normal operation.",
