            "description": "Lunary-ai/lunary version git 105a3f6 is vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The application allows users to upload their own regular expressions, which are then executed on the server side. Certain regular expressions can have exponential runtime complexity relative to the input size, leading to potential denial of service. An attacker can exploit this by submitting a specially crafted regular expression, causing the server to become unresponsive for an arbitrary length of time.",
