            "description": "The WP Posts Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘auto_play_timeout’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
