            "description": "The PeproDev Ultimate Profile Solutions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data via its publicly exposed reset-password endpoint. The plugin looks up the 'valid_email' value based solely on a supplied username parameter, without verifying that the requester is associated with that user account. This allows unauthenticated attackers to enumerate email addresses for any user, including administrators.",
