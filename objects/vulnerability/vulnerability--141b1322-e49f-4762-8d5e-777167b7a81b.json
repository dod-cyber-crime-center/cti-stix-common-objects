            "description": "A vulnerability in danswer-ai/danswer v0.3.94 allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by uploading a file with a malformed multipart boundary. By appending a large number of characters to the end of the multipart boundary, the server continuously processes each character, rendering the application inaccessible. This issue can be exploited by sending a single crafted request, affecting all users on the server.",
