            "description": "CarlinKit CPC200-CCPA Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of CarlinKit CPC200-CCPA devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of update packages on USB drives. The issue results from the lack of proper verification of a cryptographic signature. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-24356.",
