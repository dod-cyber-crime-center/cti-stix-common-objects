            "description": "Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The ckpt_path0 variable takes user input (e.g. a path to a model) and passes it to the change_info function in process_ckpt.py, which uses it to load the model on that path with torch.load, which can lead to unsafe deserialization and remote code execution. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.",
