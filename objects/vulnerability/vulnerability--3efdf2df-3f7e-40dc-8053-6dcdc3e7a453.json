            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: btrtl: Prevent potential NULL dereference\n\nThe btrtl_initialize() function checks that rtl_load_file() either\nhad an error or it loaded a zero length file.  However, if it loaded\na zero length file then the error code is not set correctly.  It\nresults in an error pointer vs NULL bug, followed by a NULL pointer\ndereference.  This was detected by Smatch:\n\ndrivers/bluetooth/btrtl.c:592 btrtl_initialize() warn: passing zero to 'ERR_PTR'",
