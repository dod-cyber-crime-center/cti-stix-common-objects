            "description": "A vulnerability in the API of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a horizontal privilege escalation attack on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters in API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted API requests to an affected system to execute an insecure direct object reference attack. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access specific data that is associated with different users on the affected system.",
