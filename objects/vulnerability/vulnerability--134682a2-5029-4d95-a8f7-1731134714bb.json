            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix memleak in certain XDP cases\n\nIf the XDP program doesn't result in XDP_PASS then we leak the\nmemory allocated by am65_cpsw_build_skb().\n\nIt is pointless to allocate SKB memory before running the XDP\nprogram as we would be wasting CPU cycles for cases other than XDP_PASS.\nMove the SKB allocation after evaluating the XDP program result.\n\nThis fixes the memleak. A performance boost is seen for XDP_DROP test.\n\nXDP_DROP test:\nBefore: 460256 rx/s                  0 err/s\nAfter:  784130 rx/s                  0 err/s",
