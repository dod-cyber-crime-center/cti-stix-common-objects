            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbnxt_en: Mask the bd_cnt field in the TX BD properly\n\nThe bd_cnt field in the TX BD specifies the total number of BDs for\nthe TX packet.  The bd_cnt field has 5 bits and the maximum number\nsupported is 32 with the value 0.\n\nCONFIG_MAX_SKB_FRAGS can be modified and the total number of SKB\nfragments can approach or exceed the maximum supported by the chip.\nAdd a macro to properly mask the bd_cnt field so that the value 32\nwill be properly masked and set to 0 in the bd_cnd field.\n\nWithout this patch, the out-of-range bd_cnt value will corrupt the\nTX BD and may cause TX timeout.\n\nThe next patch will check for values exceeding 32.",
