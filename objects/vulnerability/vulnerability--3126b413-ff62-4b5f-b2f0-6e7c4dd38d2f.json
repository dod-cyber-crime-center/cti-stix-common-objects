            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: hid-steam: Fix use-after-free when detaching device\n\nWhen a hid-steam device is removed it must clean up the client_hdev used for\nintercepting hidraw access. This can lead to scheduling deferred work to\nreattach the input device. Though the cleanup cancels the deferred work, this\nwas done before the client_hdev itself is cleaned up, so it gets rescheduled.\nThis patch fixes the ordering to make sure the deferred work is properly\ncanceled.",
