            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSv4: Fix a deadlock when recovering state on a sillyrenamed file\n\nIf the file is sillyrenamed, and slated for delete on close, it is\npossible for a server reboot to triggeer an open reclaim, with can again\nrace with the application call to close(). When that happens, the call\nto put_nfs_open_context() can trigger a synchronous delegreturn call\nwhich deadlocks because it is not marked as privileged.\n\nInstead, ensure that the call to nfs4_inode_return_delegation_on_close()\ncatches the delegreturn, and schedules it asynchronously.",
