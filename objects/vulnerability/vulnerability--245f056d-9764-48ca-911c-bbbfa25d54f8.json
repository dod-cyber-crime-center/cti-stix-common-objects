            "description": "In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations.",
