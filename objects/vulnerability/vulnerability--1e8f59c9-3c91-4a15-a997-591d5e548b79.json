            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Disable DMCUB timeout for DCN35\n\n[Why]\nDMCUB can intermittently take longer than expected to process commands.\n\nOld ASIC policy was to continue while logging a diagnostic error - which\nworks fine for ASIC without IPS, but with IPS this could lead to a race\ncondition where we attempt to access DCN state while it's inaccessible,\nleading to a system hang when the NIU port is not disabled or register\naccesses that timeout and the display configuration in an undefined\nstate.\n\n[How]\nWe need to investigate why these accesses take longer than expected, but\nfor now we should disable the timeout on DCN35 to avoid this race\ncondition. Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the\nrisk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdog\ntimeout are minimal.",
