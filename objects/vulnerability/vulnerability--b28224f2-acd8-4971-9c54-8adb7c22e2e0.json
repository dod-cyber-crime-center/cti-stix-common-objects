            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm-integrity: Avoid divide by zero in table status in Inline mode\n\nIn Inline mode, the journal is unused, and journal_sectors is zero.\n\nCalculating the journal watermark requires dividing by journal_sectors,\nwhich should be done only if the journal is configured.\n\nOtherwise, a simple table query (dmsetup table) can cause OOPS.\n\nThis bug did not show on some systems, perhaps only due to\ncompiler optimization.\n\nOn my 32-bit testing machine, this reliably crashes with the following:\n\n : Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n : CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 2450 Comm: dmsetup Not tainted 6.14.0-rc2+ #959\n : EIP: dm_integrity_status+0x2f8/0xab0 [dm_integrity]\n ...",
