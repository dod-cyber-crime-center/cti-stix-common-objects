            "description": "Insecure default settings have been found in recorder products provided by Yokogawa Electric Corporation. The default setting of the authentication function is disabled on the affected products. Therefore, when connected to a network with default settings, anyone can access all functions related to settings and operations. As a result, an attacker can illegally manipulate and configure important data such as measured values and settings.\nThis issue affects GX10 / GX20 / GP10 / GP20 Paperless Recorders: R5.04.01 or earlier; GM Data Acquisition System: R5.05.01 or earlier; DX1000 / DX2000 / DX1000N Paperless Recorders: R4.21 or earlier; FX1000 Paperless Recorders: R1.31 or earlier; μR10000 / μR20000 Chart Recorders: R1.51 or earlier; MW100 Data Acquisition Units: All versions; DX1000T / DX2000T Paperless Recorders: All versions; CX1000 / CX2000 Paperless Recorders: All versions.",
