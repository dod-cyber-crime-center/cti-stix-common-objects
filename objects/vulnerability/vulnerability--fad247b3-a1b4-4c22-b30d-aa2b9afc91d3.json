            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: ipset: fix region locking in hash types\n\nRegion locking introduced in v5.6-rc4 contained three macros to handle\nthe region locks: ahash_bucket_start(), ahash_bucket_end() which gave\nback the start and end hash bucket values belonging to a given region\nlock and ahash_region() which should give back the region lock belonging\nto a given hash bucket. The latter was incorrect which can lead to a\nrace condition between the garbage collector and adding new elements\nwhen a hash type of set is defined with timeouts.",
