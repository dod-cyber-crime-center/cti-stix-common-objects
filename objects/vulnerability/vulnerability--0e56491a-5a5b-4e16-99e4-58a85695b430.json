            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni3c: dw: Fix use-after-free in dw_i3c_master driver due to race condition\n\nIn dw_i3c_common_probe, &master->hj_work is bound with\ndw_i3c_hj_work. And dw_i3c_master_irq_handler can call\ndw_i3c_master_irq_handle_ibis function to start the work.\n\nIf we remove the module which will call dw_i3c_common_remove to\nmake cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister\nwhile the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations\nthat may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                      CPU1\n\n                                     | dw_i3c_hj_work\ndw_i3c_common_remove                 |\ni3c_master_unregister(&master->base) |\ndevice_unregister(&master->dev)      |\ndevice_release                       |\n//free master->base                  |\n                                     | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)\n                                     | //use master->base\n\nFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with\nthe cleanup in dw_i3c_common_remove.",
