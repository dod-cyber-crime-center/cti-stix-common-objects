            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: venus: hfi_parser: refactor hfi packet parsing logic\n\nwords_count denotes the number of words in total payload, while data\npoints to payload of various property within it. When words_count\nreaches last word, data can access memory beyond the total payload. This\ncan lead to OOB access. With this patch, the utility api for handling\nindividual properties now returns the size of data consumed. Accordingly\nremaining bytes are calculated before parsing the payload, thereby\neliminates the OOB access possibilities.",
