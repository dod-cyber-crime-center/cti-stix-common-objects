            "description": "In Proget MDM, a low-privileged user can access information about changes contained in backups of all devices managed by the MDM (Mobile Device Management). This information include user ids, email addresses, first names, last names and device UUIDs. The last one can be used for exploitation of CVE-2025-1416.\n\nSuccessful exploitation requires UUID of a targeted backup, which cannot be brute forced.Â \n\nThis issue has been fixed in 2.17.5 version of Konsola Proget (server part of the MDM suite).",
